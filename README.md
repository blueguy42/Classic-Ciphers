# IF4020 Cryptography: Assignment 1

Application of Classic Cipher and Cryptanalysis

## Description
In this assignment, we are required to create a website that can perform encryption and decryption using Vigenere, Affine, Playfair, and Hill Cipher algorithms. In addition, cryptanalysis is also carried out on the ciphertext using the methods of single-letter frequency analysis, Kasiski method, frequency analysis of bigrams for Playfair Cipher, and known-plaintext attack method for Hill Cipher.

## Technology Used
* Flask
* Numpy

## Usage
To run the program, run the file <b><i>app.py</i></b>

You can also run the program by opening a terminal to the  `/bagian-a` folder and running
```
python app.py
```
In the Python terminal, there will be a display:
```
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
To access the website, access the link at the bottom line (in this case, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`) on your preferred web browser. Congratulations! You can now run the Classic Cipher website.
